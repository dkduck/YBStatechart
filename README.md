YBStatechart
============

YBStatechart is a statechart framework written in Objective-C.

This framework started out as a fork of [ronaldmannak's YBStatechart] [1] framework. Then it was more or less completely rewritten to more closely resemble [SproutCore's statechart framework] [2].

Please see the YBStatechart.h and YBState.h header files for more documentation on the API.

**Attention:** This is a very early version and the included tests are not updated to the recent changes.
