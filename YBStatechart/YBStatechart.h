/**
 Statecharts are represented using instances of YBStatechart.
 For more information on statecharts, see David Harel's white paper from 1986:
 http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Statecharts.pdf
 
 A statechart object contains one rootState, which acts as an encapsulation for other substates (which can in turn have other substates
 as well). A YBStatechart instance plays the central role of activating a particular state and ensuring the appropriate sibling-,
 sub- and super- states get activated and deactivated.

 The statechart is a UIResponder subclass, so it can be hooked into the responder chain.
 Any unknown selector with zero to two arguments will be dispatched to the currently active states.
